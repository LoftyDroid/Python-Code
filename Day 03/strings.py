#Concatenating two strings
a = "what's your name:"
b = "Ahmed"
c = a+b
print(c)

# string indexing
name = "Ahmed"
print(name[2])
# name[3] --> changing value does not work , we can't the value inside a string

# String slicing
print(name[0:3]) # same print(name[:3])

print(name[-4:-1]) #It is same as name[1:4]
